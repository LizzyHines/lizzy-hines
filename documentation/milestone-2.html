<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
<p>My website will be one page and have the following sections:</p>
<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>A navigation bar at the top of the page will navigate people to the About, Skills, or Contact section of the page.</p>
<h3>Welcome/About Section</h3>
<p>A photo of me in the Bosque will span the frame, and a text frame will contain my name and my role as an aspiring developer and<br> designer. Below this will be a band of color containing several sentences about my background in visual arts and the humanities, and <br>
    what has led me to pursue a career in computer programming.</p>
<h3>Skills and Portfolio Section</h3>
<p>Below the color bar with my biography will be a short synopsis of the skills I have in programming with icons for each skill or <br>
    language. This will be accompanied by a portfolio section, with links to multiple projects' webpages and a brief summary of each project.<br>In the margins of the page will be the background image of an original piece I created.</p>
<h3>Contact Section</h3>
<p>This section will have space for anyone wishing to contact me to see my information or use the space to leave their contact information<br> and a message they want to send. The background piece in the Skills section will continue into the background of this section.</p>
