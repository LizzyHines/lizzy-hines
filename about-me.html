                <h3>Who I am:</h3>
                <p>I grew up in Dearborn, Michigan with a cat and two artist parents who fostered my love for design and travelling from a young age. I went to Henry Ford College before pursuing International Studies at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Thereafter, I was a hospitality worker for many years - server, bartender, barista - and acquired soft skills that have made it easier to move through the world. When the pandemic caused everything to shut down in 2020, I decided to jump on an idea I'd had for a while, and learned to code.</br></br>I love my community, family, my dog, Albuquerque, and being able to build with creative, compassionate people.</p>

            <h2>My Career So Far:</h3>
            <ul class="career-timeline">
                <li>
                    <p>My first tech job was as an Assistant Instructor for the Deep Dive Coding Fullstack coding bootcamp. I helped students with learning a modified MERN stack.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I delved into freelancing and have been able to work with several clients on exciting projects, including helping clients with development and design, and creating a prototype for an app idea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I became a software developer and project coordinator for a local general contractor. I was tasked with helping create a project- and time-management app to help streamline their production. I needed to created mockups in Figma to illustrate ideas and workflows, and my passion for UI/UX was born.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I was then hired at MTX Group initially as a Salesforce Developer, but was then put on their UI/UX team and became a UX Consultant. I contributed to several government projects through coding in an SLDS frontend, participating in discovery calls, and creating mockups and prototypes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I now continue to freelance, and would love to work with you!</p>
