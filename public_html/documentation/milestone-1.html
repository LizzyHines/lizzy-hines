<h1>Personal Web Project: Milestone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I would like for my PWP to be the potential about-me page for my professional website. It will contain a brief<br>
    explanation of my personal and professional history, skills and interests while showcasing the languages I've<br>
    learned in this program. From this bootcamp I hope to pursue web development and UI/UX design, as part of my <br>
    background is in the visual arts. Because of that, at some point I would also like to have a part of my website<br>
    devoted to either selling or offering commissions, as well as displaying other creative, nonprofessional ventures<br>
    I decide to follow (blog, .
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>Potential clients and those I am able to connect with via networking will be viewing my site, along with others just<br>
    wishing to view my art. My intended audience is made up of those in the technology field and creatives. I hope that my<br>
    peers would be able to appreciate it as well as I further my networking.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>I hope for my website to give me a platform to both express myself while showcasing the technical and desirable job<br>
    skills I have to solve client solutions. I hope for it to gain me both clients and a reputation for integrity in what<br>
    I do. I hope that through my work I am able to solidify myself as an integral part of my community and the industry, <br>
    while also being able to explore my creativity.</p>

<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
<p>She keeps up with personal and business accounts on social media for marketing, but has been needing a properly done <br>
    website to enable selling merchandise online and building a customer base. She knows that having a website would be <br>
    great for her business, but she often finds her time devoted to roasting the beans and ensuring the business runs smoothly. </p>

<p>She is finding it difficult to stay competitive in the growing coffee industry here in the city, especially in appealing <br>
    to younger customers and coffee lovers. She needs better marketing and visibility.</p>

<p>She would like to solidify herself as a member of the coffee community and Albuquerque itself. She wants to alleviate <br>
    the stresses of marketing with a well-done website so she can focus on making a good product.</p>
<p>Francesca would use my site to understand my style and artistic choices to decide if I could do what she would <br>
    like on her platform. She would be able to view my portfolio and learn more about me to determine if she would like to work together.</p>
<p>I would work with Francesca to not only create an engaging website, but also help her define her brand <br>
    to help the design of the site be as cohesive and user-friendly as possible. I would make an interface that is <br>
    graphically beautiful while also being easy with which to navigate ecommerce for her products.</p>
