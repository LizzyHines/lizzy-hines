<h1>Personal Web Project: Milestone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I would like for my PWP to be the potential about-me page for my professional website. It will contain a brief<br>
    explanation of my personal and professional history, skills and interests while showcasing the languages I've<br>
    learned in this program. From this bootcamp I hope to pursue web development and UI/UX design, as part of my <br>
    background is in the visual arts. Because of that, at some point I would also like to have a part of my website<br>
    devoted to either selling or offering commissions, as well as displaying other creative, nonprofessional ventures<br>
    I decide to follow.
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>Potential clients and those I am able to connect with via networking will be viewing my site, along with others just<br>
    wishing to view my art. My audience will be made up of those in the technology industry and creatives. I hope that my<br>
    peers would be able to appreciate it as well as I further my networking.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>I hope for my website to give me a platform to both express myself while showcasing the technical and desirable job<br>
    skills I have to solve client solutions. I hope for it to gain me both clients and a reputation for integrity in what<br>
    I do. I hope that through my work I am able to solidify myself as an integral part of my community and the design industry.</p>
