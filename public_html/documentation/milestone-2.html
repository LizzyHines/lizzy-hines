<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
<p>My website will be one page, and will consist of the following elements:</p>
<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
<p>A navigation bar at the top of the page will navigate people to either the About, Skills, or Contact section of the page.</p>
<h3>Welcome/About Section</h3>
<p>A photo of me in the Bosque will span the frame, and a text frame will contain my name and my role as an aspiring<br> developer and designer. Below this will be a band of color containing several sentences about my background in visual arts and the<br> humanities, and what has led me to pursue a career in computer programming.</p>
<h3>Skills Section</h3>
<p>Below the color bar with my biography will be a short synopsis of the skills I have in programming and in digital media. This will be on a bordered section of text with icons depicting each specific skill. In the margin of the page will be the background image of an original digital media piece I created.</p>
<h3></h3>
